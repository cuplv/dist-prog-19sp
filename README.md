The focus of this reading group is on languages, abstractions, and verification tools for distributed programming. Our reading list is taken from [Lindsey Kuper](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/)'s fantastic course [Languages and Abstractions for Distributed Programming](http://composition.al/CMPS290S-2018-09/course-overview.html) at UC Santa Cruz. As in her course, we focus on consistency models and language-based approaches to specifying, implementing, and verifying them. In the last two weeks, we turn our attention to formal verification of distributed systems.
